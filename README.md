# RSA-Algorithm-Standard-Encryption-and-Decryption-Techniques
A python made project to demonstrate different types of RSA algorithm decryption techniques which are Long Factorization using primes, 
Chinese algorithm and Fault key generation techniques.

To run the project :
1. Open the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run Command : python Main.py
3. Enter Bit Length and Text to encrypted as Input.
4. Enter the method you want to use : 1 for Long Factorization, 2 for Chinese Algorithm and 3 for Fault key generation.
5. Run the program.
